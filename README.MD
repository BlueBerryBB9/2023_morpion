current_tasks :
    - TD5
    - issue: can't listen on the same port because each netplayer instances a new listener -> maybe use a class with static listener accessible everywhere
      BECAUSE i can't pass one through IPlayer constructor because it is a NetPlayer need only
    - ask to Elise about upper question
